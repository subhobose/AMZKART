E-commerce Platform
You must’ve seen multiple online retail platforms. Some great examples of such platforms are Amazon and
Flipkart. In this DBMS project, you’ll have to develop a similar e-commerce platform, where a customer
can register and buy a product.
Your developed platform should have a registration window where the user will provide their name, bank
name, and bank account number. This information will enable them to make transactions easily. After
they’ve registered, the system should give them unique user IDs and customer IDs. They should have the
option to set up their passwords.
Any e-commerce platform would be incomplete without having any products to sell, wouldn’t it? So it
should have product listings as well, classified according to their prices (or some other criterion). The user
should have the option to buy one or more products from your platform. And after the user makes a
purchase, the system would generate an invoice, which will contain the user’s name. The system can allow
ordering from different suppliers according to availability.
Using DBMS for an e-commerce platform will give you extensive experience in this technology. It’ll help
you understand how online platforms use and interact with databases. Still, this project will undoubtedly
take some time and effort.
This project makes for one of the most relatable database projects, as e-commerce uses databases for
tracking transactions, and products database, the marketing team also uses the DBMS to track the traffic,
acquire potential customers and retain existing customers. The e-commerce industry is running on having
a strong database because it is online, and data is the new oil. Also, just having data is not enough, having
a strong ecosystem of a string core database is what makes it all efficient.
